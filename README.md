# INCIDENT REPORT FORM
Online Form Submission for CFAN Overwatch:
  - I took a paper form and converted it to digital for our (former) security team there
  - We needed something that would work on mobile so the appropriate person could file the report immediately and with ease
  - I worked with the Head of Security and the Executive Pastor on this project

## Church For All Nations
Digizited Form App has functionality of:
  - accept online form submission
  - save the report to a db
  - update existing reports
  - display reports on screen
  - email notification of form submissions
  - submit feedback regarding the web app
  - export a report as .pdf (wasn't completed at time of the Church split)
